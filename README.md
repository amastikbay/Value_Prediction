# Player Market Value Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the market values of football players using machine learning techniques. It was created as a final project for course 449 by Amir Mastikbayev and Ege Sumer.

## Objective

To build a robust model that estimates the value of football players based on various features such as age, position, nationality, goals, assists, and other performance metrics.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for building the predictive model
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## Dataset

We used a cleaned dataset containing statistics of professional football players including:
- Demographics (age, nationality)
- Position-specific features
- Performance metrics (goals, assists, appearances)
- Transfer market value

> NOTE: The dataset was pre-processed to handle missing values and normalize outliers before modeling.

## Machine Learning Approach

- Feature selection and scaling
- Model comparison (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.)
- Final model: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Performance Metrics: 
  - R² Score: ~0.98
  - MAPE: ~6%

## Key Features

- End-to-end supervised ML pipeline
- Feature importance analysis
- Model evaluation with appropriate metrics
- Clean, visual presentation of results

## Business Use Case

Football clubs and agents can use this model to:
- Assess fair transfer value of players
- Benchmark team roster values
- Make informed decisions in the transfer market

## Results

The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy, making it a valuable tool for clubs, agents, and analysts aiming to understand or negotiate player market values.
